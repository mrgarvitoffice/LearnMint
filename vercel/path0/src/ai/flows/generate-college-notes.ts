# 🟦 UNIT 2: FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS AND COST ESTIMATION

## 🧠 INTRODUCTION

A software feasibility study is conducted in the early stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to determine whether the proposed system is viable, cost-effective, legally compliant, and technically achievable. This unit also covers cost estimation, a critical part of project planning and resource allocation.

---
## ✅ CORE CONCEPTS

---
### 🔹 Feasibility Study: Definition

- It is an evaluation of how successfully a software project can be completed.
- Involves analyzing the project's technical, economic, legal, operational, and scheduling aspects.
- Conducted before the main development begins to avoid project failure or cost overruns.

---
### 🔸 Types of Feasibility (Mnemonic: TELOS)

1.  **🛠 Technical Feasibility**
    - Determines whether the existing technology is sufficient.
    - Checks hardware, software, and technical skills.
    - Example: Can your team build a mobile app using Flutter if they’ve only used Java before?

2.  **💰 Economic Feasibility**
    - Cost-benefit analysis: Will the benefits outweigh the development costs?
    - Includes ROI, break-even point, and risk of loss.
    - Example: Is it worth spending ₹10 lakhs to build an e-learning app that may generate ₹12 lakhs?

| 🧩 Topic | Description | 🌐 Preview Link |
|---|---|---|
| Spiral Model | Iterative dev with risk analysis | [VISUAL_PROMPT: Diagram of the Spiral Model in software engineering] |
| Feasibility Tree | Decision diagram with TELOS branches | [VISUAL_PROMPT: A decision tree showing the types of feasibility study] |
| COCOMO Graph | Cost vs. KLOC estimation graph | [VISUAL_PROMPT: A graph showing the COCOMO cost estimation curve] |

---
## 💡 TIPS & EXAM HACKS

- ✍ TELOS mnemonic is essential for types of feasibility — write all 5 in answers!
- 📉 Draw a simple COCOMO formula box for extra marks
- ✅ Mention at least 2 real-world examples (e.g., mobile app, banking system)

---
## ❓ PRACTICE QUESTIONS

1.  Define feasibility study. Explain its types with real-world examples.
2.  Compare Function Point and COCOMO models.
3.  Explain cost estimation and factors affecting it.

---
## 📎 SUMMARY

- A feasibility study ensures that a software idea is practical and justified.
- Cost estimation helps avoid over-budgeting and delays.
- Models like COCOMO make predictions based on project size.
